My research focuses on leveraging the connection between galaxies and dark matter to constrain cosmology. The next decade will oversee a remarkable amount of highly precise survey data. In order to fully exploit this information across all scales, we require fast and accurate forward models. I am thus a proponent of Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT): a hybrid perturbative bias model that incorporates information from dark matter N-body simulations to probe weakly nonlinear scales. I have used HEFT to quantify the uncertainty in galaxy formation models, and am now constructing a simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline for inferring cosmology from clustering using a redshift-space HEFT model. I am also concurrently modeling the quasar-halo connection in Quaia, a quasar dataset, which will contribute to building more robust models of structure formation.

My past research experience has included:
- building mock catalogs with f(R) gravity
- comparing clustering in warm and cold dark matter models
- validating numerical relativity waveforms for gravitational waves
- visualizing regions of ionized hydrogen in galaxy simulations
- searching for gamma ray bursts
