My research focuses on leveraging the connection between galaxies and dark matter to constrain cosmology. The next decade will oversee a remarkable amount of highly precise survey data. In order to fully exploit this information across all scales, we require fast and accurate forward models. I am thus a proponent of Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT): a hybrid perturbative bias model that incorporates information from dark matter N-body simulations to probe weakly nonlinear scales. I have used HEFT to [quantify the uncertainty in galaxy formation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06886), and am now constructing a simulation-based inference pipeline for inferring cosmology from clustering using a redshift-space HEFT model. I am also concurrently modeling the quasar-halo connection in [Quaia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17749), a large quasar dataset, which will contribute to building more robust models of structure formation.

My past research experience has included:
- [building mock catalogs with f(R) gravity](https://zenodo.org/records/4074045)
- comparing clustering in warm and cold dark matter models
- [validating numerical relativity waveforms for gravitational waves](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18046)
- [visualizing regions of ionized hydrogen in galaxy simulations](https://cierareu.northwestern.edu/2018CIERA_REU_websites/MahletShiferaw/research.html)
- searching for gamma ray bursts
