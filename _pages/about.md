I am a 4th year Physics Ph.D. Candidate at Stanford University. I am in [Dr. Risa Wechsler's group](https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html), where I primarily study computational cosmology. My current interests include structure-formation modeling and galaxy bias. You can view my work on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=2&user=cL4njVMAAAAJ), and read more about my research [here](https://mshiferaw.github.io/publications/).

In my free time, I am passionate about outreach and diversity initiatives in astronomy and physics. I have organized a Black in Physics group here at Stanford University, and encourage minority students to reach out to me. I am also an [artist](https://www.instagram.com/artbymahlet/)!
