I am a 5th-year Physics Ph.D. Candidate at Stanford University, advised by [Professor Risa Wechsler](https://www.risawechsler.com/gfc-group.html) within the Kavli Insitute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology. My research interests broadly include exploring the galaxy-dark matter connection, particularly through structure-formation modeling and galaxy bias. You can view my work on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=2&user=cL4njVMAAAAJ) or [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/astro-ph?searchtype=author&query=Shiferaw,+M).

I am passionate about outreach and diversity in astronomy and physics. I have organized a [Black in Physics](https://physics.stanford.edu/inclusion/black-physics-stanford) group here at Stanford University, and actively engage in science communication through the [Wonderfest Science Envoys Program](https://wonderfest.org/science-envoy/). I am also a Stanford Data Science Scholar.

In my free time, I love running, exploring San Francisco, and making [art](https://www.instagram.com/artbymahlet/).
