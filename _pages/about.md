I am a 4th year Physics PhD Candidate at Stanford University. I am in Dr. Risa Wechsler's group and primarily work on computational cosmology. My current interests include structure-formation modeling and galaxy bias. You can view my work on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=2&user=cL4njVMAAAAJ), and read more about my research here.

In addition to research, I am passionate about outreach and diversity initiatives in astronomy and physics. I have organized a Black in Physics group here at Stanford University -- if you are a minority in this field in any way, please feel free to reach out to me (I particularly encourage Black students). I am also an artist in my free time!
