I am a 4th year Physics PhD Candidate in Dr. Risa Wechsler's group at Stanford University. I primarily work on computational cosmology, and my current interests include structure-formation modeling and galaxy bias. You can view my work on [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&authuser=2&user=cL4njVMAAAAJ), and read more about my research here.

In addition to research, I am passionate about outreach and diversity initiatives in astronomy and physics. I have organized a Black in Physics group here at Stanford University, and encourage minority students to reach out to me. I am also an artist in my free time!
